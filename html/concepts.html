<!--    <h1>Concept definitions</h1>

    <a name="todo"></a>
    <h3>Todo</h3>

    <p>A <span class='concept'>regulon</span> is the set of all the
      genes regulated by a given transcription factor (e.g. the LexA
      regulon).</p>

    <a name="operon"></a>
    <h3>Operon</h3>

    <p>An <span class='concept'>operon</span> is a set of genes
      transcribed in a single transcription unit. A transcription unit
      comprizing several coding sequences is qualified
      of <span class="concept">polycistronic</span>. </p>

    <p>Operons are very frequent in Bacteria, where they usually
      regroup sets of genes involved in a same biological process
      (e.g. the his operon contains the genes required to code for all
      the enzymes of histidine biosynthesis).</p>

    <p>In eukaryotes, genes ere generally transcribed as
      mono-cistronic units (an mRNA only codes for a single
      polypeptide). A notable exception if found in Trypanosoma, where
      large polycistronic units are transcribed, which regroup
      functionally unrelated genes, and regulation occurs essentially
      at the post-transcriptional level.  </p>
